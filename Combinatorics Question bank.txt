1) In a school, one President, one treasurer, and one secretary are to be chosen, from a students committee of 10 persons.
No person can hold two posts at a time.
In how many ways can this happen?

Ans: 10C1*9C1*8C1 = 720

2) A student participates in four different sports on Sport’s Day at her school. Each sport has three medals assigned, gold, silver, and bronze.
It is possible that the student wins no medals. How many possible ways can she get at least one medal?

Ans: 4 sports and each sport has 4 combination on medals (gold, silver, bronze and no medal). Therefore total combination is 4^4 = 256. Out of these many combinations 1 combination is there where student didn't win any medal in all 4 sports comibined so she get at least one medal = 256-1 = 255

3) A company wants to form an elite team of 5 members to assign a particular project.
Suppose the company has 5 Data Scientists, 4 Data Engineers, and 6 Data Analysts.
Find the probability that the company will select a team that contains 2 Data Scientists, 1 Data Engineer, and 2 Data Analysts

Ans: DS = 5C2, DE = 4C1, DA = 6C2. Therefore the Required combination is DS*DE*DA. Total people to choose from is 5+4+6=15, total required people = 2+1+2 = 5. There Total Combination is 15C5. Now the probability = Required combination/Total Combination = (5C2*4C1*6C2)/15C5 = 0.1998

4) Twenty distinct cars park in the same parking lot every day. Ten of these cars are India-made. while the other ten are foreign-made.
The parking lot has exactly twenty spaces all in a row, so the cars park side by side.
What is the probability that on a given day, the cars will park in such a way that they alternate (e.g., India-made, foreign-made, India-made, foreign-made, etc)?

Ans: 10! for Indian cars combination, 10! for Foreign cars cobmination, Total combination is 10!*10! but combination can start from Indian Car as well as Foreign car so 2 type, therefore alternate car combination = 2*10!*10!. Total combination is 20!. Probability = Total Combination of cars/alternate car combination = 2*10!*10!/20! = (2*10!*(20-10)!)/20! = 2/20C10

5) How many five-character-long passwords can be created such that the first two characters can use any digit from 0 to 9, and the last three characters can use letters from A to Z?

Ans: 10 numbers * 10 numbers * 26 letters * 26 letters * 26 letters = 1,757,600

6) A Machine Learning course contains 5 ‘Supervised Learning’, 6 ‘Unsupervised Learning’, and 2 ‘Reinforcement Learning’ modules. One of the students wants to revise these topics and picks two modules at random.
Find the probability that one module is of ‘Unsupervised Learning’ and one is of ‘Supervised Learning’.

Ans: SL = 5C1, UL = 6C1, RL = 2C0. Required Combination = 5C1*6C1*2C0. Total Combination = 13C2. Probability = (5C1*6C1*2C0)/13C2 = 30/78 = 15/39 = 5/13

7) Suppose you’re making a list of three digit numbers.
Answer the following questions:
i) How many three digit numbers are there that do not contain 5?
ii) Which contain 5 at least once?
iii) Which contains 5 at most once?

Ans: i) 8 choices as 0 and 5 cannot be at 100th place, 9 choices as 5 cannot be at 10th place, 9 choices as 5 cannot be at 1th place. Therefore combination: 8*9*9 = 648
    ii) Total combination of 3 digit number = 9*10*10 = 900. Number of combination that doesnot contain 5 = 648. Therefore Combination with 5 at least once = 900-648 = 252
   iii) 5 at most once = (total) – (numbers having 5 in all the places + numbers having 5 in exactly two places) = 900-(The number having 5 in all the places is 555[1 possiblity]+The numbers having 5 in two places (but not all) are 55_, 5_5, and _55[9+9+8]) = 900-(1+26) = 900-27 = 873
